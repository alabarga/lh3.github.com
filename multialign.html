  Popular multialignment programs include: clustalw, T-coffee, dialign

  probcons
  [PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15687296">15687296</a>]
  and probalign
  [PMID: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16954142">16954142</a>]. Which
  is the best in practice? You can find various benchmarks in the papers
  listed above. I only summarize based on my understanding. It is
  recommended to read their papers in case my summary is biased. Also,
  both accuracy and speed may vary a lot with different data sets. I can
  only give results based on the data used in their papers.</p>
<p>
  Firstly, these software can be divided into two groups: those
  performing global multiple alignment and those performing local
  multiple alignment. In global alignment, each residue of each sequence
  is required to be aligned. This category includes clustalw, T-coffee,
  muscle, probcons and probalign. In local alignment, some residues are
  allowed to be unaligned. Only segments that closely related are
  aligned together. This category includes dialign family and
  MAFFT. They can also perform global alignment.</p>
<p>
  Most benchmarks are designed for global aligners. The consensus seems
  to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>accuracy: probalign&gt;probcons&gt;MAFFT&gt;muscle&gt;T-coffee&gt;&gt;clustalw~dialign</li>
  <li>speed: clustalw~muscle&gt;MAFFT&gt;dialign&gt;&gt;probcons&gt;probalign~T-coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Only MAFFT and dialign performs local alignment. The dialign paper
  claims that dialign is much more accurate. However, I doubt this
  largely depends on the definition of high-scoring segments. We can
  always find tighter alignment by excluding more residues.</p>
<p>
  Then, what is the best? Muscle or MAFFT. Although probcons and
  probalign are more accurate, they run impractically slower than muscle
  and MAFFT. As for the winner between muscle and MAFFT, I cannot
  decide. I also need to evaluate the memory consumption, usability and
  stability. I have only used muscle. It is a really nice program.
