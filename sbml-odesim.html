<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  If you check
  the <a href="http://sbml.org/SBML_Software_Guide/SBML_Software_Summary">SBML
  software guide</a>, you will find a bunch of programs that simulate
  ODE models in SBML. It is good to see a complete list, but most people
  would just like to use one of them. Choosing between these many
  programs is really a pain. I have experienced the pain and want to
  help others a little bit.
</p>
<h2>Choosing the SBML Simulator</h2>
<h3>My demands</h3>
<p>
  I do not need a command-line tool because I already have my C library
  or the open-source
  library <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</a> to do
  that. I want to use a program with GUI, allowing me to see the
  graphical time-course output and to change parameters conveniently.
</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="http://sbml.org/SBML_Software_Guide/SBML_Software_Summary">SBML
  software guide</a> provides a fairly complete list of available ODE
  simulators that are compatible with
  SBML. The <a href="http://www.sys-bio.org/sbwWiki/doku.php?id=sysbio:sbw">SBW</a>
  group
  present <a href="http://www.sys-bio.org/sbwWiki/compare">comparisons</a>
  between several solvers, which focus on the robustness and accuracy of
  a program rather than on efficiency. That page further links to two
  other comparisons,
  one <a href="http://ntcnp.org/twiki/bin/view/VCell/SBMLFeatureToolMatrix">by
  the VCell</a> group (feature comparison) and the
  other <a href="http://www.biouml.org/biomodels.shtml">by the
  BioUML</a> group. The google search may eventually direct you
  to <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/meetings/2ndTrainingCamp/biomodels07.pdf">these
  slides</a> which may give you an idea on the efficiency.
</p>
<h3>My experiences</h3>
<p>
  After going through these pages, I decide to try two
  programs: <a href="http://www.systems-biology.org/cd/">CellDesigner</a>
  (using <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~raim/odeSolver/">SOSlib</a>) and
  <a href="http://www.copasi.org/tiki-index.php">Copasi</a>.
  <a href="http://www.biouml.org/">BioUML</a> and
  <a href="http://cbbl.imim.es:8080/ByoDyn">ByoDyn</a> also look good,
  but BioUML require Java6 which I have not installed and ByoDyn is a
  bit difficult to install as it requires several libraries.
</p>
<p>
  CellDesigner and Copasi are generally comparable in features, accuracy
  and speed. While CellDesigner may be more friendly to biologists,
  Copasi is powerful in mathematical tools. For a person, like me, who
  focus on the mathematical aspect of the model, copsi is clearly the
  better choice.
