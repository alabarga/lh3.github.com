<h2><a name="bg">Background</a></h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation">Stiff ODEs</a>
  are evil. Most of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential
  equations will become unbearably slow when the ODEs are
  stiff. Unfortunately, a large set of ODEs are frequently stiff in
  practice. It is very important to use an ODE solver that solves stiff
  equations efficiently.
</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="ns">Solvers for non-stiff equations</a></h2>
<h3><a name="ns-ov">An overview of methods</a></h3>
<p>
  Most of the classical numerical methods for solving ODEs are for
  non-stiff equations only. These methods include the
  simplest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler
  method</a>, the most widely used
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta">fourth-order
  Runge-Kutta method</a> (RK4), the
  adaptive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg_method">Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg
  method</a> (RKF), the
  adaptive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash–Karp_method">Runge-Kutta-Cash–Karp
  method</a> (RKCK), the
  adaptive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormand–Prince_method">Runge-Kutta-Dormand–Prince
  method</a> and the
  multi-step <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistep_method">Adams'
  method</a> (predictor-corrector method). You can find the detailed
  description of RK4 and RKCK methods
  in <a href="http://www.nr.com/">Numerical Recipes</a> or other similar
  textbooks. Euler and Runge-Kutta methods are one-step methods in that
  they refer only to one previous value to determine the current
  value. Adams' method, which refers to several previous function
  values, is quite different and is probably less known to people, but
  this method may potentially incur few function calls
  [<a href="http://math.fullerton.edu/mathews/n2003/AdamsBashforthMod.html">reference</a>].
</p>
<h3><a name="ns-im">Implmentations</a></h3>
<p>
  It is fairly easy to implement the 4th order Runge-Kutta
  method. Adaptive methods are not hard, either. You can largely read
  the textbook and write your own
  version. The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific
  Library</a> (GSL) has implemented all the one-step methods above. The
  interface is also very convenient.
</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="st">Solvers for stiff equations</a></h2>
<p>
  Solvers for stiff equations usually require to evaluate
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix">Jacobian</a>,
  which can be very expensive. Sophisticated solvers usually
  automatically switch between stiff and non-stiff methods to achieve
  good performance in both cases. Please read the next section for the
  well known implementations.
</p>
<h3><a name="st-rm">Rosenbrock Methods</a></h3>
<p>
  This method is described in Numerical Recipe. It is relatively simple
  to implement, but its performance is quickly degraded when we require
  higher precision (beyond ~1e-5), which is confirmed by my
  experience. This is not a good general-purpose method.
</p>
<p>
  Apparently, for stiff equations, <a href="">XPP</a> uses the
  Rosenbrock method.
</p>
<h3><a name="st-BSBD">Bulirsch-Stoer-Bader-Deuflhard semi-implicit methods</a></h3>
<p>
  Numerical Recipe (2nd edition) describes this method as "an excellent
  routine for all stiff problems", although "very occasionally" it "will
  encounter a singular matrix". Unfortunately, given my ODEs, this case
  frequently occurs to the implementation in the book.
</p>
<p>
  GSL comes with an alternative implementation (namely bsimp) of this
  method. This implementation does not complain about singular matrix,
  but incurs much more function calls than RKCK on one of my
  examples. Apparently, this is not a good general-purpose method,
  either.
</p>
<h3><a name="st-rk">Implicit Runge-Kutta methods</a></h3>
<p>
  GSL also provides the implicit 2nd/4th order Runge-Kutta
  methods. These methods, however, do not seem to outperform the
  explicit methods (see below).
</p>
<h3><a name="st-BDF">Backward Differentiation Formulae (BDF or Gear methods)</a></h3>
<p>
  Different from the above methods, BDF is a multi-step method. It is
  probably the most widely used method for stiff
  equations. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HurESoDQljcC">Numerical
  Algorithms with C</a>
  gives <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#JC4RawIU7d4/17/gear.c">a
  good implementation</a> apparently.
</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="lv">LSODE and VODE</a></h2>
<p>
  LSODE and VODE are probably the best known ODE solvers, both in
  Fortran and developed by the <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence
  Livermore National Laboratory</a>. LSODE eventually evolves into
  <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/odepack/odepack_home.html">ODEPACK</a>,
  while VODE into CVODE as part of
  the <a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html">Sundials
  package</a>. Older versions of ODEPACK and CVODE can also be found
  at the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/">netlib</a> repository.
</p>
<h3><a name="lv-lo">LSODE and ODEPACK</a></h3>
<p>
  According to <a href="http://www.netlib.org/odepack/opkd-sum">this
	page</a>, ODEPACK consists of LSODE and its eight variants. LSODA is
  one of them, which automatically switches between the Adams' method
  and the BDF method. A C version of LSODA is available
  <a href="http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/C/kinetics2/lsoda-dir/index.shtml">here</a>,
  but few people are using that to my knowledge.  I further combined the
  source codes, fixed a few minor bugs and added a more convenient (but
  less versatile) interface. You can download my
  version <a href="download/lsoda.c">here</a>. The complete
  documentation for the Fortran version are available
  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/alliant/ode/prog/lsoda.f">at netlib</a>,
  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/odepack/opkdmain.f">from odepack</a> or
  <a href="http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/C/kinetics2/lsoda-dir/lsoda.doc">from
  CCL.NET</a>. According to the tiny benchmark below, LSODA greatly
  outperforms other simple stiff or non-stiff methods.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, Mathematica also combine the Adams method and the BDF
  method to solve ODEs
  [<a href="http://controls.engin.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/Solving_ODEs_with_Mathematica#Gear_Method">reference</a>].
</p>
<h3><a name="lv-vc">VODE and CVODE</a></h3>
<p>
  VODE was developed after LSODE. Its C version, CVODE which is included
  in the Sundials package, is believed to be the best ODE solver for C
  programs. An older version of CVODE can be
  found <a href="http://www.netlib.org/ode/cvode.tar.gz">here</a>. I do
  not know how much it differs from the latest version. Apparently,
  CVODE does not automatically choose between stiff and non-stiff
  methods
  [<a href="http://odetoolkit.hmc.edu/docs/solvers.html">reference</a>].
</p>
<h3><a name="lv-lv">LSODA vs. CVODE</a></h3>
<p>
  VODE was developed later and in its paper, the author claimed that
  VODE outperformed LSODE. That paper was published over 20 years ago
  and a lot have happened to the two packages. I do not know how the two
  programs are compared now and am not aware of any systematic
  benchmark. An implicit comparison is actually done by
  the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~raim/odeSolver/">SOSlib</a>
  developers. In
  a <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/meetings/2ndTrainingCamp/biomodels07.pdf">presentation</a>,
  they showed SOSlib, which uses CVODE, achieves similar performance to
  <a href="http://www.copasi.org/tiki-index.php">Copasi</a> which uses
  LSODA.
</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="cp">A (very rough) comparison on ONE set of ODEs</a></h2>
<p>
  I have a set of ODEs describing 41 genes/proteins and 63 reactions
  between them. The system approaches to a fixed point at t=100.0
  approximately. I run several ODE solvers on these ODEs and checked how
  many iterations and function evaluations are required to integrate to
  t=100.0. The following table shows the results. Methods with a star
  require a user-provided function to calculate the Jacobian. I did not
  count the function calls on calculating the Jacobian.
</p>
<table>

<tr><th>gsl-bsimp*<td align="right">458<td align="right">79,914</tr>
</table>
<p>
  Lsoda is clearly the best on these ODEs. It requires far fewer
  function evaluations than the rest. Nr-rkck outperforms gsl-rkck/rkf45
  probably due to the details in implementation. RKCK and RKF45 are also
  good candidates given their simplicity. Gsl-rk8pd uses the 8-9th order
  RKPD method. It approaches the fixed point with fewer iterations than
  RKCK, but requires more function evaluations and thus is less
  efficient. I am not sure if gsl-gear1/2 and gsl-rk2/4imp are suitable
  for stiff equations. Apparently they do not seem to be. Gsl-bsimp and
  nr-stiff are both designed for stiff ODEs and both require user-provided
  routines to calcuate the Jacobian. However, they are not comparable to
  the others on this example.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the performance of a solver highly depends on the
  characteristics, in particular the stiffness, of the input ODEs. You
  will probably come to a different conclusion given another set of
  ODEs.
</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="cl">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>
  LSODA is a good ODE solver especially when you do not know whether
  your ODEs are stiff or not. One potential concern comes from its
  implementation. The C version of LSODA have many global variables,
  which makes it unsuitable for solving more than one set of ODEs. A
  better implementation should pack all the global variables into a
  struct.
