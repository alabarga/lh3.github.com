<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular
expressions</a> (regex) is often the most convinient approach for
parsing text files. The performance of regex matching may be critical
when the input files are huge, which is quite common in analyzing
biological data. Most scripting languages support regex and there are
various C/C++ libraries, too, but surprisingly few have evaluated their
performance. This page aims to provide a preliminary benchmark on the
performance of several regex libraries as well as scripting
languages.</p>
<h2><a name="design">Design</a></h2>
<h3>Input text</h3>
<p>The text file for this benchmark is a version of concatenated
Linux <a href="http://people.unipmn.it/manzini/lightweight/corpus/howto.bz2">howto</a>
document. This file has 39,422,105 bytes, 5,330,321 words and 1,086,077
lines (according to <tt>wc</tt>). The maximum line length is 533 and the
median is 33.</p>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<ol>
  <li>URI (protocol://server/path): <tt>([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)://([^ /]+)(/[^ ]*)?</tt>
  <li>Email (name@server): <tt>([^ @]+)@([^ @]+)</tt>
  <li>Date (month/day/year): <tt>([0-9][0-9]?)/([0-9][0-9]?)/([0-9][0-9]([0-9][0-9])?)</tt>
  <li>URI|Email: <tt>([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)://([^ /]+)(/[^ ]*)?|([^ @]+)@([^ @]+)</tt>
</ol>
<p>It should be note that the above regular expressions may not be
  strictly correct or the optimal. We just need something to test the
  performance.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that matching word boundaries is not required
  by POSIX regex. For the patterns above, we may simply check the
  character before and after the matching region to test if the entire
  match is a word.</p>
<h3>Matching</h3>
<p>
  The benchmarking program reads the file and tests matching line by
  line. The tailing new line character is trimmed as different libraries
  may treat it differently.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Column `Algo' indicates the algorithm for
  regex. `BT'=backtracking, and `FSA'=finite state machine.
  <li>Column `UTF-8' indicates if the library explicitly supports UTF-8
	encoding. See also the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Unicode">Unicode</a>
	section on wiki.
  <li>Column `Perl' denotes if the library supports
	advanced perl-compatible syntax, such as word boundaries and back
	reference.
  <li>Column `Light' shows whether the library is implemented in two
	files: a header and a source file. Such two-file libraries can be
	easily included in a 3rd-party program at the source-code level,
	which makes the 3rd-party program less dependent on external APIs.
  <li>Column `URI', `Email' and `Date' give the CPU seconds for finding
	all matching lines given the three regular expressions above,
	respectively. Column `Sum3' gives the sum of CPU seconds for `URI',
	`Email' and `Date'.
  <li>T-Rex gives additional matching lines for `URI', which is
  incorrect.

<h2>Discussions</h2>
<p>
  <b>Note</b>: boost::xpressive, Glib, Tcl and V8 were added later. The
  discussions below did not consider these implementations.
</p>
<h3>Backtracking vs. state machines</h3>
<p>
  Regex libraries are typically implemented with backtracking (BT) or
  finite state machine (FSA). The former approach is more flexible but
  can be exponential in time given some regex. The latter guarantees
  polynomial time in searching, but usually less flexible. RE2 is
  believed to be the only library that uses FSA and supports Perl-like
  syntax at the same time.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, implementations based on BT and FSA seem to have similar
  performance on short regex. However, FSA may greatly outperform BT
  given the `|' operator in regex. This means for BT-based
  implementations, matching with multiple regex is preferred.
</p>
<h3>Speed of C/C++ regex libraries</h3>
<p>
  For `|'-free regex, onig is the winner. PCRE and RE2 are similar in
  performance. The regex library from Mac OS X is comes in the next
  place. Of the three light-weight library, only regexp9 is close to the
  performance of matured libraries. TRE and boost::regex are nearly 8X
  slower than onig on `|'-free regex.. The T-Rex and NCBI port of regex
  are the slowest implementations.
</p>
<p>
  For `|'-contained regex, the results are changed a lot. RE2 clearly
  beats all the rest. Regexp9 and TRE, the other two FSA based libraries
  come in the second and the third places, respectively. Several
  BT-based algorithms such as onig and PCRE are 10X slower than using
  two regex separately, although this is not true for all BT-based
  algorithms.
</p>
<h3>Speed of standalone programs and scripting languages</h3>
<p>
  GNU's egrep is fast mainly because it hybridizes regex matching with
  Boyer-Moore search. I do not know how exactly this is done, but I do
  hope other regex may adopt this heuristics. On all the regex I have
  tried, egrep is the fastest. Another possible reason that egrep is
  fast may be because it does not keep track of grouping.
</p>
<p>
  Perl is surprisingly fast as a scripting language. Python, on the
  contrary, is surprisingly slow. I heavily rely on regex for parsing
  huge text files. This benchmark tells me that python, although faster
  than perl in other applications, is not the right language for me.
</p>
<h3>C vs. C++</h3>
<p>
  I used PCRE's POSIX APIs in the table above. If I use its C++ APIs,
  PCRE becomes 10% slower. C++ interfaces incur minor overheads.
</p>
<p>
  For boost::regex, I implemented two versions: one uses the fgets()
  libc API and the other uses std::getline() to read into a C++
  string. The already-slow boost::regex becomes 50% slower, which means
  50% CPU time goes to a function as simple as getline()! Why not
  implement getline() by calling fgets()?
</p>
<h3>Alternative benchmarks</h3>
<p><a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/">Russ Cox</a>, the developer of the
RE2
library, <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html">evaluated</a>
the performance of RE2 and PCRE. He seems to be using long texts, while
my programs match line by line. The results may not be comparable.
</p>
<p>
  Google search will bring us
  to <a href="http://softwareramblings.com/2008/08/c-regular-expression-performance.html">this
  page</a>. The conclusion broadly agrees with mine: PCRE is
  significantly faster than boost::regex. Nonetheless, that benchmark is
  not performed in a realistic context.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://snowplow.org/martin/rebench/">This page</a> evaluates
  the performance of regex matching of several scripting languages. It
  also points out that python is slower in regex matching. Another
  interesting conclusion from that page is perl is efficient given
  `/FOO/ || /BAR/' but very inefficient given `/FOO|BAR/'. So I also
  added this type of regex to my benchmark.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=regexdna&lang=all">regex-dna</a>
  benchmark from <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">The
  Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a> shows that Python is faster than
  Perl. This may be related to Perl's inefficiency given `/FOO|BAR/'. I
  have not tested this, though.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
  Before I did this benchmark, I thought all regex implementations are
  similar in performance, like what happens to the hash table
  libraries. To my big surprise, the fact is the contrary. The
  performance varies a lot between implementations and between
  regex. Most widely used implementations such as boost::regex, Python,
  Perl and gawk all have striking weakness.
</p>
<p>
  In this benchmark, RE2 seems to be the overall winner. It is
  feature-rich and among the fastest for all 4 regex. More importantly,
  it does not suffer from the worst-case problem. RE2 is implemented in
  C++. For C programmers, onig or PCRE is a good choice. However, to use
  these two libraries, we should be aware that regex containing the `|'
  operator may greatly degrade the performance. If this is a concern,
  one may consider regexp9. Regexp9 is featured as its small code size
  (&lt;1300 lines of code) which makes it the ideal library when we want
  to include the source code in a project to avoid an extra library
  dependency.
