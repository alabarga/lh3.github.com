  Eland is probably the first short read aligner. It reports a tag,
  which can be `[UR][0-2]|NM', for each read to indicate if the read is
  mapped uniquely, repetitively or unmapped. Since then, we are used to
  talking about `mapping uniqueness' and extend the concept to generic
  alignments without asking ourselves what is the exact definiation of
  uniqueness and if such a concept is useful in practice at all.
</p>
<p>
  For Eland, mapping uniqness is clearly defined. A read is said to be
  aligned uniquely if the best two alignments have identical number of
  mismatches. Eland requires the full-length read to be aligned and it
  does not do gapped alignment. Such a definition is useful to
  downstream analyses.
</p>
<p>
  However, when we consider base quality, the usefulness of uniqueness
  becomes less obvious. Suppose a read has no perfect match and two
  1-mismatch hits. The first hit has a Q5 mismatch and the second has a
  Q30 mismatch. If the quality is accurate, the first hit is clearly
  better than the second. Why couldn't we trust the first hit?
</p>
<p>
  In addition, as is pointed out by one of the anonymous reviewers of my
  BWA paper, an aligner may not be able to find the best hits if
  heuristics are in use, and in this case, the aligner is only able to
  find `unique' reads by its own definition.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, once we allow gaps, mapping uniqueness becomes even less
  useful. Firstly, we need to redefine uniqueness as we have gaps. One
  possible way is to define a read as being uniquely mapped if the best
  two alignments have identical number of differences (mismatches plus
  gaps). The definition is clear, but not useful. We know on Illumina
  reads indel errors occur rarely. A hit containing one mismatch is
  definitely preferred over a hit with one gap.
</p>
<p>
  Things get even worse when we clip reads as what we do for capillary
  reads. We can only define a read being uniquely mapped when the top
  two alignments have identical alignment score. However, this is almost
  practically useless at all. For long reads, frequently we get
  alignments with similar scores, but we seldom get two with identical
  scores.
</p>
<p>
  Uniqueness was initially introduced to measure the reliability of
  ungapped short read alignment with a read aligned in full length. It
  is not a proper concept for generic alignments. For generic
  alignments, what is much more useful is mapping quality, first
  introduced in my maq paper. Mapping quality is phred-scaled
  probability of the alignment being wrong. It unambiguously measures
  the alignment reliability in a universal way. Calculating mapping
  quality is related to a proper statistical alignment/error model, and
  this is the right thing to do. I would strongly recommend all aligners
  to report mapping quality. Mapping uniqueness was not widely used two
  years ago and will not be widely used two years later. It is just a
  temporary concept, reflecting our lack of knowledge on measuring the
  reliability of an alignment.
