<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  <a href="NGSalign.html">Many short read aligners</a> have been
  developed in the last two years, but few are widely used nowadays.
  For most people who are not familiar with algorithms, the adoption of
  an aligner is largely determined by its popularity. Heavily used
  aligners almost certainly have fewer bugs and deliver better practical
  performance. If you have questions, you are more likely to get answers
  from others. How can an aligner gain its popularity? There are many
  reasons, but to me, the key is its practibility which is a combination
  of several factors including speed, features and memory. Although
  practical aligners may not be always popular due to timing, licensing
  or other subtle and complicated issues, popular aligners are always
  practical. No exceptions.
</p>
<p>
  This article largely reflects the philosophy behind my own aligners,
  maq and bwa. It focuses on short-read aligners but many claims are
  also applicable to other high-performance tools in bioinformatics.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Popular Short-read Aligners</h2>
<p>
  Before going into details on how practibility is achieved, I give a
  list of aligners that are widely used to the best of my knowledge. The
  list may be biased due to my own limitations, but it is a reasonable
  start, anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Probably the most frequently cited short read aligner
  is <a href="http://maq.sourceforge.net">MAQ</a>, my first short read
  aligner. It has been used in several high-profile papers and
  large-scale projects. However, the development of maq is very slow in
  the last year as my focus is shifted
  to <a href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net">BWA</a> which has several
  advantages over maq. Nonetheless, maq may still occassionally
  outperform bwa in a few aspects and that is why maq is not retired yet.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://soap.genomics.org.cn/">SOAP</a> is the first published
  short read aligner. It used to be widely used given its capability of
  finding short indels on single-end reads, but not at present due to
  the development of other new aligners as well as its
  successor <a href="http://soap.genomics.org.cn/">SOAP2</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net">Bowtie</a> is popular due
  to its efficiency, flexibility and active maintainance, although I am
  always a little concerned about its default behaviour (I believe
  "--best -k 2" is better).
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.novocraft.com">NovoAlign</a> is a commercial
  software, but you are allowed to use its binary freely as long as you
  aim to publish your results. Novoalign is the most accurate in my
  benchmark done half a year ago. It is actively maintained and highly
  feature rich. A potential concern to me is its free version does not
  support multithreading which may cause some difficulties in running it
  in large scale.
</p>
<p>
  Aligners such
  as <a href="https://secure.genome.ucla.edu/index.php/BFAST">Bfast</a>,
  <a href="http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/Mosaik">Mosaik</a>,
  <a href="http://mrfast.sourceforge.net/">mrFast</a>
  and <a href="http://biogibbs.stanford.edu/~jiangh/SeqMap/">SeqMap</a>
  are also mentioned in some publications and/or forums, but my
  impression is they have not reached the popularity of maq, bowtie, bwa
  and soap/soap2 due to timing and various other reasons.
</p>

<h2>Being Practical</h2>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>
  For an aligner, speed is always the first thing that comes to our
  sight and the first thing developers care about. It is largely
  determined by the algorithm. People all have paid enough attention to
  this factor, although sometimes too much.
</p>
<h3>Feature set</h3>
<p>
  To me, the completeness of feature sets outweighs the speed in
  evaluating an aligner. A practical short-read aligner must be able to
  work with &gt;100bp reads, perform paired-end mapping, tolerate
  moderately high error rate and support the standard formats
  (e.g. FASTQ and SAM). Doing gapped alignment becomes more and more
  important with the increasing read lengths. Other features like
  capability of non-standard alignment (e.g. bisulfite alignment),
  adapter trimming, low-quality trimming and more are not mandatory but
  also likely to increase the popularity.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, not many developers have paid enough attention to the
  feature set of their aligners and some even trade features for speed
  (e.g. only allowing very short reads), which makes a lot of aligners
  less useful in practice, even when they are published.
</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>
  The importance of the memory usage of an aligner is frequently
  overlooked at the beginning but quickly rediscovered when the aligner
  is put into use in large scale.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays, 8-core computers with 16GB memory are pretty affordable and
  widely used. In most large sequencing centers (at least the ones I
  have been to), 32GB and 64GB machines are rare due to their relatively
  high cost. This means a reasonable aligner should not use more than
  ~12GB memory to leave some memory for other jobs running on the 16GB
  machine. And for aligners using more than 4GB memory, multithreading
  becomes necessary; otherwise we could hardly use the computing
  resources effectively given the memory limit. Nonetheless, even with
  multithreading, memory below 7GB in total is still preferred when the
  aligner is used in a large compute farm because the average load of a
  farm is descreased given many multithreading jobs which increase the
  idle time in waiting enough CPU slots.
</p>
<p>
  Running jobs on a large compute farm involes more practical concerns
  than on a single computer, and attracting users on such farms is
  really the short-cut to popularize an aligner. Even for users working
  on a single computer, small memory usage is frequently much more
  friendly and affordable.
</p>
<p>
  To be practical, an aligner should even trade speed for memory,
  although some developers do the reverse to show good results in their
  speed benchmark. But ultimately, memory hungry aligners will be faced
  with problems even if they get published.
