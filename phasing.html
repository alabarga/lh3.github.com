<p><a href="http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html">PHASE</a> is
the gold standard in phasing genotype data. It is proved to be the most
accurate program for such task. However, PHASE is a bit slow to be
applied on hundreds of markers given hundreds of individuals, which
leads to the development of several new phasing programs including
<a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/prastas/">BACH</a>,
<a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~browning/beagle/beagle.html">BEAGLE</a>,
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ventures/UW_Technology/Express_Licenses/fastPHASE.php">fastPHASE</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/genetics/haplotyping.html">HaploRec</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/prastas/hit/">HIT</a>
and <a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html">MACH</a>. How
do they perform? This page, which is largely inspired
by <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/b875774841033m21/">Rastas <i>et
al.</i> (2008)</a>, will give you a rough idea.</p>

<h2>Coalescent simulation</h2>
<p>Coalescent simulation was done
by <a href="http://www-hsc.usc.edu/%7Egarykche/">MaCS</a> with the
command line adapted
from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16895447">Plagnol and
Wall (2006)</a>. 100 European and 100 African haplotypes of length
100kbp were generated, comprising of 100 diploid individuals in
total. All the segregating sites were retained without adding missing
genotypes. Individuals from the two populations were mixed together and
fed to the phasing programs as input. The MaCS command line is:</p>
<textarea name="code" class="c:nocontrols:nogutter" cols="100" rows="10">
macs 200 100000 -t 0.03764 -r 0.07528 -I 2 100 100 160 -g 1 4303.9 \
  -g 2 41228 -eg 0.00107 1 0. -eg 0.0001117 2 0. -en 0.000775 2 9.1e-05 \
  -en 0.000785 2 0.01 -ej 0.0016 2 1
</textarea>
<p>It is <b>important</b> to note that the performance of a phasing
program may vary a lot given different types of input data. Here I do
not mean to provide a comprehensive benchmark on various conditions, but
to give a naive view of how these programs differ from each other in one
experiment which could be more realistic if:
<ul>
  <li>European and African populations were not mixed.
  <li>A better demographic model was used.
  <li>Not all segregating sites were included.
  <li>Not all genotypes were present.
  <li>Performance breakdown was shown given different sample sizes, LD,
	etc.
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Fast Phasing Programs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>BACH. BACH seems a bit slow on large data set.
  <li>BEAGLE. Beagle compresses the information in the data with a
	variable-length HMM. Evaluated.
  <li>fastPHASE. Based
	on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704198">Li and
	  Stephens (2003)</a> model. Evaluated.
  <li>HaploRec. I tried but could not get a sensible result. Probably it
	is my fault in making the input, but I could not evaluate it anyway.
  <li>HIT. The same reason as HaploRec.
  <li>MACH. Based on Li and Stephens model. Evaluated.
  <li>PHASE. Based on Li and Stephens model. It (v2.1) cannot handle
	"more than approximately 100 markers at once" according
	to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18850115">Browning
	(2008)</a> and is not evaluated here.
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Measurement</h2>
<p>The most widely used measurement for evaluating phasing accuracy is
switch error rate
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14574645">Stephens and
Donnelly,
2003</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16465620">Marchini
et al., 2006</a>) which equals the switch distance between the true
phased sequences and the inferred phased sequences divided by the
maximum possible switch distance. Given two pairs of phased sequences,
the switch distance between them is the minimum number of switches
required to produce one pair of phased sequences from the other
pair. The maximum possible switch distance equals the number of
heterozygotes minus the number of diploid individuals. Switch error rate
is zero if all the heterozygotes are phased correctly.</p>
<br>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>First of all, the accuracy of a program is affected by the command
  line options. Usually the more iterations and more hidden states are
  used, the more accurate the results. Specifically, fastPHASE's speed
  is linear to -T and -C; MACH's speed is linear to --rounds and
  quadratic to --states. I am not sure how speed is scaled to other
  command-line options without carefully studying the algorithms
  behind.</p>
